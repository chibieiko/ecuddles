# eCuddles

Spring Boot REST backend and [react frontend](https://github.com/chibieiko/ecuddles-front) for a fictional soft toy store.

# Run instructions

To run the [self contained jar](https://github.com/chibieiko/ecuddles-backend/releases/download/1.0/team-evil-r4.jar), you have to have Java 8 installed.

Go to the same folder as the downloaded jar, and run:

`java -jar team-evil-r4.jar`

This might take a while, but after it says "Started EcuddlesApplication", the website and backend should be hosted on [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080).

**Demo admin account:** admin@admin.com, password: admin

App is also running in [heroku](https://ecuddles.herokuapp.com/), but it's horribly slow there as it's a free server.
